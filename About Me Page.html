    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Bridget Feng</h2>

    <p>My name is Bridget Feng. I'm currently a sophomore in Staten Island Technical High School and I will be
        graudating in 2025. I was born in New York City and have resided here ever since. I enjoy listening to music
        (speaking of which, here's the link to a
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/71i3wlanzjflfYz0gkT2W8?si=44bad58af1774998">song I like<a>)
                and watching Netflix. In no particular order, here are some things I find enjoyable:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>drawing</li>
        <li>naping</li>
        <li>live music</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I like entertainment, so here's a list of online subscriptions ranked (1 being the most used, 3 being the least
        used):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Spotify Premium</li>
        <li>Netflix</li>
        <li>Amazon Prime Video</li>
    </ol>
